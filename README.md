# Aventura, Drupal 7 Installation Profile and Theme
This installation profile and theme are designed to help designers and site builders get a head start on configuring a Drupal 7 site. The included Aventura theme uses Omega 3 as the base.

The installation profile also comes with loads of configuration options including: 

- Omega 3 base theme
- SASS support
- multi-author blog
- SEO optimized
- Font Awesome icons
- unlimited font choices
- daily backups and more. 

Another feature is a full page hero image on the front page. Don't want the image? It's easy to reconfigure the front page to use the same layout as the other pages on the site.

See a [live demo](http://aventura.friendlymachine.net) of the installation profile. Although this project profile is not actively supported, I would appreciate any bug reports.
